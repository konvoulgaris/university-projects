# text-sentiment-recognition
A text sentiment recognition machine learning web app, originally developed for the requirements of the course [Advanced Topics in Data Analytics (DS-532)](https://www.ds.unipi.gr/en/courses/advanced-topics-in-data-analytics/).

It is designed to be able to accept text from the user, analyze it using a Word2Vec model and display the text sentiment prediction using an SVM model.

## How to Run
To make running this application easier, a Dockerfile is provided which automatically setups the application. Simply open your terminal, run the following command:

```bash
docker run --rm -d -p 5000:5000 konvoulgaris/text-sentiment-recognition:latest
```

And then go to the following address:

[http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

Alternatively, you can build the image yourself:

```bash
docker build --rm -t text-sentiment-recognition:latest .
docker run --rm -d -p 5000:5000 text-sentiment-recognition:latest
```

Enjoy! ðŸ˜Š
