# movieflix
A movie database management web application, originally developed for the requirements of the course [Information Systems (DS-512)](https://www.ds.unipi.gr/en/courses/information-systems-2/).

It is designed to be an IMDb-like web application that allows users to see information about movies, leave ratings and / or comments and see other people's ratings and / or comments. Additionally, there are special users (i.e. admins) which have the ability to edit all movie and user data using an admin-only "Manage" page.
