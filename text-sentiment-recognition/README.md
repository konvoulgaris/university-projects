# text-sentiment-recognition
A text sentiment recognition machine learning web app, originally developed for the requirements of the course [Advanced Topics in Data Analytics (DS-532)](https://www.ds.unipi.gr/en/courses/advanced-topics-in-data-analytics/).

It is designed to be able to accept text from the user, analyze it using a Word2Vec model and display the text sentiment prediction using an SVM model.

## How to Run
